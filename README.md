This is an application for creating scrum backlogs for different projects. Users can create multiple projects and each project can have multiple taskboards. On the taskboard tasks are divided into 4 columns, "Not started", "Started", "In review" and "Done". Tasks can be dragged between columns. In addition to task management the application also provides some statistics about the tasks.
